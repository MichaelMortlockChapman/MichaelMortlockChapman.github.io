# Example Project (Simple Snake Game)
A React implementation of Snake. Find it [here](https://michaelmortlockchapman.github.io/snake). This simple project was built to demonstrate my knowledge and skills with ReactJS as an example project. The webpage mimics Nintendoâ€™s Gameboy Colour as the game controller. The game uses the dpad for movement and the menu/start buttons for opening the pause menu (the A and B buttons are unutilised for this project). Furthermore the 'Game Boi' was built as a component, so other games/projects could reuse the asset.

The game starts with a simple option menu. Which allows the user to enable portals (allow the snake to teleport from the sides of the screen rather than getting a game over) and different game speeds for varying difficulties. The game follows the normal snake gameplay of trying to 'eat' as many apples (red tiles) as possible without a game over. Additionally, the pause menu allows the user to restart the game or return to the options menu (press menu/start to resume game).

## Possible Project Improvements
- Scoreboard
- Keyboard controls
